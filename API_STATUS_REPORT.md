## ⚠️ Current Issue: Rate Limit Exceeded

### Error Details
```
[429 Too Many Requests] You exceeded your current quota
```

This means:
- Your API key has been used too many times in a short period
- Google Gemini **free tier** limits:
  - 15 requests per minute
  - 1,500 requests per day
  - 1M tokens per month

### Likely Cause
The API key may have been used for testing before you added it to this project.

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option 1: Wait (Recommended for Free Tier)
**If you're on the free tier:**
- Wait 1 minute for the rate limit to reset
- Limits reset automatically
